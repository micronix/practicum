# Practicum

The purpose of the practicum is to learn the best practices of working in a team on a larger project.
After you complete the practicum you should:

- Feel comfortable working on a team (using git)
- Understand how to write tests for your code

You will probably have to use existing gems to provide the required functionality. We have used the Devise gem in the past.
It is conceivable that you will have to do research on what gems are available and determine which is the best choice by considering pros and cons.
You will then have to learn how to integrate the gem into your app.

The projects are not fully specified and you will have to ask questions to John or Ramiro.
We are developing something that doesn't exist yet, something that doesn't have a right and wrong answer.
We will guide you but try to use your best judgment and be creative. Think how the user would use the software and have fun.
