# How to Follow the CTD Workflow

- Review "Doing" and make sure you only have one card there.
  - complete what you can get done on this card
  - if you cannot proceed further move the card back to inprogress
- Review "In Progress"
  - pick something that you can proceed on from "In Progress" move to "Doing"
  - if you have nothing you can proceed on in "In Progress" pick something from "This Iteration"
  - first pick tasks assigned to you then pick something not assigned to anyone

If at some point while you are working you find a bug or you see a problem that we should
discuss as a team, add it to "BID".

When you complete a card create a pull request and add John or Ramiro to review the PR.
